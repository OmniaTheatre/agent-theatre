According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Please design a python app which uses Alpha Vantage to scrape historical stock data. Please design it to read a list of ticker names from a file and use META, TSLA, MSFT, and PLTR as a starting point. Store the historical 1-minute interval data for each in a spreadsheet in a format that will be easy to evaluate and train an ML model on, being sure each ticker has it’s own sheet or workbook. Include in this spreadsheet columns for: RSI, MACD, 9EMA, 20EMA, 50EMA, 200EMA, VWAP, ADX, and Stochastic indicator. Design the algorithm so that it cycles from the currently date and time, running backwards to fill in data for the past 20 years".

Modality: "excel".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the required modules in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from tkinter import Tk
from tkinter import filedialog
```

Also, update the `select_file()` function to use `Tk()` instead of `tk.Tk()`.

```python
def select_file():
    root = Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()
    if file_path:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            tickers = file.read().splitlines()
        scrape_data(tickers)
```

This will ensure that the necessary modules are imported and the file selection dialog works correctly.

Once you have made these changes, the code should be ready for execution.

6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer, Jewel. We are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully build our business.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new task: Please design a python app which uses Alpha Vantage to scrape historical stock data. Please design it to read a list of ticker names from a file and use META, TSLA, MSFT, and PLTR as a starting point. Store the historical 1-minute interval data for each in a spreadsheet in a format that will be easy to evaluate and train an ML model on, being sure each ticker has it’s own sheet or workbook. Include in this spreadsheet columns for: RSI, MACD, 9EMA, 20EMA, 50EMA, 200EMA, VWAP, ADX, and Stochastic indicator. Design the algorithm so that it cycles from the currently date and time, running backwards to fill in data for the past 20 years.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and our needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the required modules in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from scraper import StockDataScraper
from spreadsheet import StockDataSpreadsheet
```

Also, the code is missing the implementation of the `scrape_data` method in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following code below the `select_file` method:

```python
def scrape_data(tickers):
    scraper = StockDataScraper()
    spreadsheet = StockDataSpreadsheet()
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = scraper.scrape(ticker)
        spreadsheet.save_data(ticker, data)
```

With these changes, the code should be able to import the required modules and scrape the historical stock data as intended.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the required modules in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statements at the beginning of the main.py file:

```python
from scraper import StockDataScraper
from spreadsheet import StockDataSpreadsheet
```

Also, the code is missing the implementation of the `scrape_data` method in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following code below the `select_file` method:

```python
def scrape_data(tickers):
    scraper = StockDataScraper()
    spreadsheet = StockDataSpreadsheet()
    for ticker in tickers:
        data = scraper.scrape(ticker)
        spreadsheet.save_data(ticker, data)
```

With these changes, the code should be able to import the required modules and scrape the historical stock data as intended."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
openpyxl>=3.0.7
requests>=2.26.0
```

This `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary packages for the project:

- `numpy` is required for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- `pandas` is required for data analysis and manipulation.
- `openpyxl` is required for working with Excel files.
- `requests` is required for making HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API.

You can create the `requirements.txt` file and include it in your project directory.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
openpyxl>=3.0.7
requests>=2.26.0
```
This `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary packages for the project:
- `numpy` is required for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- `pandas` is required for data analysis and manipulation.
- `openpyxl` is required for working with Excel files.
- `requests` is required for making HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API.
You can create the `requirements.txt` file and include it in your project directory. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Executive Officer, Ptolemy. Now, we are both working at Omnia Theatre and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully build our business.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on strategy, business direction and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new project task: Please design a python app which uses Alpha Vantage to scrape historical stock data. Please design it to read a list of ticker names from a file and use META, TSLA, MSFT, and PLTR as a starting point. Store the historical 1-minute interval data for each in a spreadsheet in a format that will be easy to evaluate and train an ML model on, being sure each ticker has it’s own sheet or workbook. Include in this spreadsheet columns for: RSI, MACD, 9EMA, 20EMA, 50EMA, 200EMA, VWAP, ADX, and Stochastic indicator. Design the algorithm so that it cycles from the currently date and time, running backwards to fill in data for the past 20 years.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and our needs.]

# Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper

The Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper is a Python application designed to scrape historical stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.

To install the Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone the repository or download the source code from the GitHub repository: [Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper](https://github.com/omniatheatre/stock-data-scraper)

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) by running the following command:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage by signing up for a free account on their website: https://www.alphavantage.co/

8. Open the `scraper.py` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

9. Save the changes and close the file.

## Usage

To use the Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a text file containing a list of ticker names, with each ticker name on a separate line. For example:

   ```
   META
   TSLA
   MSFT
   PLTR
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` file by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. A file selection dialog will appear. Choose the text file containing the ticker names.

4. The scraper will retrieve the historical stock data for each ticker from the Alpha Vantage API and store it in separate sheets or workbooks in an Excel spreadsheet.

5. The spreadsheet will be saved in the current directory with the ticker name as the filename (e.g., `META.xlsx`, `TSLA.xlsx`, etc.).

## Spreadsheet Format

The generated Excel spreadsheet will have the following columns for each ticker:

- Timestamp: The date and time of the data point.
- Open: The opening price of the stock.
- High: The highest price of the stock during the interval.
- Low: The lowest price of the stock during the interval.
- Close: The closing price of the stock.
- Volume: The trading volume of the stock.

Additionally, the spreadsheet will include the following columns for each ticker:

- RSI: The Relative Strength Index indicator.
- MACD: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator.
- 9EMA: The 9-day Exponential Moving Average.
- 20EMA: The 20-day Exponential Moving Average.
- 50EMA: The 50-day Exponential Moving Average.
- 200EMA: The 200-day Exponential Moving Average.
- VWAP: The Volume Weighted Average Price.
- ADX: The Average Directional Index indicator.
- Stochastic: The Stochastic indicator.

## Data Range

The algorithm is designed to cycle from the current date and time, running backwards to fill in data for the past 20 years. However, please note that the availability of historical data may vary depending on the stock and the Alpha Vantage API.

## Conclusion

The Omnia Theatre Stock Data Scraper is a powerful tool for scraping and storing historical stock data for multiple tickers. It provides a convenient way to retrieve and organize the data in a format that is suitable for further analysis and machine learning model training.
