Task:
Please design a python app which uses Alpha Vantage to scrape historical stock data. Please design it to read a list of ticker names from a file and use META, TSLA, MSFT, and PLTR as a starting point. Store the historical 1-minute interval data for each in a spreadsheet in a format that will be easy to evaluate and train an ML model on, being sure each ticker has itâ€™s own sheet or workbook. Include in this spreadsheet columns for: RSI, MACD, 9EMA, 20EMA, 50EMA, 200EMA, VWAP, ADX, and Stochastic indicator. Design the algorithm so that it cycles from the currently date and time, running backwards to fill in data for the past 20 years
