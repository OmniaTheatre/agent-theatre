**task_prompt**: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

| **task_prompt** | We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the questrade.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the questrade.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer, Jovin. we are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPI` class in the `questrade.py` module is missing the implementation of its methods. These methods need to be implemented to interact with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data. 

To fix this, you need to complete the implementation of the methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class in the `questrade.py` module. Each method should have the necessary logic to communicate with the Questrade API and retrieve the corresponding data.

For example, the `get_account_status` method should make a request to the Questrade API to retrieve the account status, and the `get_balances` method should retrieve the account balances.

Once you have implemented these methods, you can test them by calling them from the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in the `gui.py` module, where you can use the `QuestradeAPI` instance to retrieve the required data for the algorithmic trading application.

Remember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain its purpose and functionality.

After implementing and testing the methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class, you can proceed with reviewing the rest of the code and ensuring that it meets the requirements specified by the user.

Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPI` class in the `questrade.py` module is missing the implementation of its methods. These methods need to be implemented to interact with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data. 

To fix this, you need to complete the implementation of the methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class in the `questrade.py` module. Each method should have the necessary logic to communicate with the Questrade API and retrieve the corresponding data.

For example, the `get_account_status` method should make a request to the Questrade API to retrieve the account status, and the `get_balances` method should retrieve the account balances.

Once you have implemented these methods, you can test them by calling them from the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in the `gui.py` module, where you can use the `QuestradeAPI` instance to retrieve the required data for the algorithmic trading application.

Remember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain its purpose and functionality.

After implementing and testing the methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class, you can proceed with reviewing the rest of the code and ensuring that it meets the requirements specified by the user."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer, Krishe. we are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

| **task_prompt** | We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction |

Each method should have the necessary logic to communicate with the Questrade API and retrieve the corresponding data.\n\nFor example, the get_account_status method should make a request to the Questrade API to retrieve the account status, and the get_balances method should retrieve the account balances.\n\nOnce you have implemented these methods, you can test them by calling them from the QuestradeAPIWrapper class in the gui.py module, where you can use the QuestradeAPI instance to retrieve the required data for the algorithmic trading application.\n\nRemember to add appropriate comments to each method to explain its purpose and functionality.\n\nAfter implementing and testing the methods in the QuestradeAPI class, you can proceed with reviewing the rest of the code and ensuring that it meets the requirements specified by the user.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` is not properly utilizing the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py`. The `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class should inherit from the `QuestradeAPI` class and call its methods instead of creating a separate instance of `QuestradeAPI`. This will ensure that the authentication and other API methods are properly implemented and utilized.

To fix this, modify the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` as follows:

```python
class QuestradeAPIWrapper(QuestradeAPI):
    def __init__(self, access_token):
        super().__init__(access_token)
```

This will make `QuestradeAPIWrapper` inherit from `QuestradeAPI` and utilize its methods correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` is not properly utilizing the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py`. The `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class should inherit from the `QuestradeAPI` class and call its methods instead of creating a separate instance of `QuestradeAPI`. This will ensure that the authentication and other API methods are properly implemented and utilized.

To fix this, modify the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` as follows:

```python
class QuestradeAPIWrapper(QuestradeAPI):
    def __init__(self, access_token):
        super().__init__(access_token)
```

This will make `QuestradeAPIWrapper` inherit from `QuestradeAPI` and utilize its methods correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer, Krishe. we are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

| **task_prompt** | We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` is not implemented. This class is supposed to be a wrapper around the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py`, but it is currently empty. To fix this, you need to implement the necessary methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class so that it can properly authenticate with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data.

<Suggestion>
1. In `gui.py`, import the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py` at the top of the file.
2. In `gui.py`, implement the necessary methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class by calling the corresponding methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class. For example, you can implement the `authenticate` method as follows:

```python
def authenticate(self, username, password):
    super().authenticate(username, password)
```

3. Repeat step 2 for the other methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class, making sure to call the corresponding methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class.

Once you have implemented the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class, the code should be able to properly authenticate with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data.

In gui.py, import the QuestradeAPI class from questrade.py at the top of the file.\n2. In gui.py, implement the necessary methods in the QuestradeAPIWrapper class by calling the corresponding methods in the QuestradeAPI class. For example, you can implement the authenticate method as follows:\n\npython\ndef authenticate(self, username, password):\n    super().authenticate(username, password)\n\n\n3. Repeat step 2 for the other methods in the QuestradeAPIWrapper class, making sure to call the corresponding methods in the QuestradeAPI class.\n\nOnce you have implemented the QuestradeAPIWrapper class, the code should be able to properly authenticate with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class in `gui.py` is not implemented. This class is supposed to be a wrapper around the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py`, but it is currently empty. To fix this, you need to implement the necessary methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class so that it can properly authenticate with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data.

<Suggestion>
1. In `gui.py`, import the `QuestradeAPI` class from `questrade.py` at the top of the file.
2. In `gui.py`, implement the necessary methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class by calling the corresponding methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class. For example, you can implement the `authenticate` method as follows:

```python
def authenticate(self, username, password):
    super().authenticate(username, password)
```

3. Repeat step 2 for the other methods in the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class, making sure to call the corresponding methods in the `QuestradeAPI` class.

Once you have implemented the `QuestradeAPIWrapper` class, the code should be able to properly authenticate with the Questrade API and retrieve the required data."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer, Krishe. we are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer, Jovin. we are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

requirements.txt

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
matplotlib>=3.3.2
seaborn>=0.11.0
ta==0.7.0
```

In addition to the existing dependencies, I have added the following packages:

- matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- ta: A technical analysis library that provides various technical indicators for analyzing financial markets.

These packages can be installed using the pip package manager by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You are Chief Executive Officer, Ptolemy. Now, we are both working at Omnia Theatre and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: We need to design an algorithmic trading application with a graphical interface for monitoring account status, balances, positions, as well as potential trades being monitored, active trades, and a log of closed trades. The application needs to keep a strict log of all trades that are made, complete with statistical analysis on the trades and the potential trade set-ups the algorithm is considering, and it must follow strict risk management that gives our trades a statistical edge toward successfully capturing profit, while minimizing losses on losing trades. We need to use the Canadian brokerage Questrade so use the access token of access_token=UksNMCeLid3FtK67x3xYxtndUHHu8QOf0 to acquire historical data from the past 5 years. Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
matplotlib>=3.3.2
seaborn>=0.11.0
ta==0.7.0
```
In addition to the existing dependencies, I have added the following packages:
- matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- ta: A technical analysis library that provides various technical indicators for analyzing financial markets.
These packages can be installed using the pip package manager by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

Capture as much data as we can to make, train, and test our algorithm. Include functionality to create a historical log of popular stocks with highly liquid options contracts, as we will be trading options with this algorithm. I would like to track the 50 most liquid and highly-traded options pools, so if possible, generate a list of these stocks and output their historical price action into excel workbooks. We need to develop an algorithm with edge and a competitive risk-reward strategy, so please use a series of momentum indicators to track market trends to alert for a play with high statistical probability based on price action and effective momentum indicators. Select appropriate python libraries for indicators and backtesting, and use any combination of indicators that appear to give a statistical edge on successfully tracking the trend direction.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
