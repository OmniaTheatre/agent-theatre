We are a hedgefund. We need to design, code, and backtest a new automated trading algorithm which finds potential trades to make based on a set of heuristic criteria. Choose rules based on high-performing momentum trading strategies and use a number of momentum-based indicators selected to give us maximum edge and minimum risk. Please select a simple and free source of market data, and similarly free and easy-to-use libraries for indicators, backtesting, and anything else we may need.
