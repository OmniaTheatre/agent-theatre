Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer, Jovin. We are both working at Omnia Theatre. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully build our business.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new task: We are a hedgefund. We need to design, code, and backtest a new automated trading algorithm which finds potential trades to make based on a set of heuristic criteria. Choose rules based on high-performing momentum trading strategies and use a number of momentum-based indicators selected to give us maximum edge and minimum risk. Please select a simple and free source of market data, and similarly free and easy-to-use libraries for indicators, backtesting, and anything else we may need..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and our needs.]

In this implementation, we have the following files:

1. main.py: This is the main file that creates the GUI window and handles the button click event to run the trading algorithm.

2. trading_algorithm.py: This module contains the TradingAlgorithm class, which is responsible for loading market data, calculating momentum-based indicators, and executing the trading algorithm based on heuristic criteria.

3. market_data.csv: This is a sample market data file in CSV format, which is used by the trading algorithm for backtesting.

To run the automated trading algorithm, you can execute the main.py file. It will open a GUI window with a "Run Algorithm" button. Clicking the button will trigger the execution of the trading algorithm, and a message box will display the result.

Please note that you need to replace the "market_data.csv" file with your own market data file or use a suitable free source for market data. Additionally, you may need to install the required libraries, such as pandas and talib, using pip or any other package manager.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the classes and libraries used in the code. Additionally, there are a few improvements that can be made to enhance the functionality and readability of the code.

1. In the `main.py` file, add the following import statements at the beginning of the file:
```python
from tkinter import Tk, Button, messagebox
from trading_algorithm import TradingAlgorithm
```

2. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:
```python
import pandas as pd
import talib
```

3. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add comments to the methods `load_data()` and `calculate_indicators()` to explain their purpose and functionality.

4. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `run()` method to include the trading strategy based on the calculated indicators. Currently, the method returns a static string. Replace the comment `# Add your trading strategy here based on the indicators` with the actual trading strategy implementation.

5. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `calculate_indicators()` method to return the calculated indicators (`sma` and `rsi`) instead of printing them.

6. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `load_data()` method to return the loaded data instead of printing it.

7. In the `main.py` file, modify the `run_algorithm()` function to display the result returned by the `run()` method of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in a message box.

8. In the `main.py` file, replace the line `window.mainloop()` with `tk.mainloop()`.

9. Ensure that the necessary dependencies (such as `pandas` and `talib`) are installed in the Python environment.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution and interaction with the user interface.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code provided seems to be missing the necessary import statements for the classes and libraries used in the code. Additionally, there are a few improvements that can be made to enhance the functionality and readability of the code.

1. In the `main.py` file, add the following import statements at the beginning of the file:
```python
from tkinter import Tk, Button, messagebox
from trading_algorithm import TradingAlgorithm
```

2. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:
```python
import pandas as pd
import talib
```

3. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add comments to the methods `load_data()` and `calculate_indicators()` to explain their purpose and functionality.

4. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `run()` method to include the trading strategy based on the calculated indicators. Currently, the method returns a static string. Replace the comment `# Add your trading strategy here based on the indicators` with the actual trading strategy implementation.

5. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `calculate_indicators()` method to return the calculated indicators (`sma` and `rsi`) instead of printing them.

6. In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, modify the `load_data()` method to return the loaded data instead of printing it.

7. In the `main.py` file, modify the `run_algorithm()` function to display the result returned by the `run()` method of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in a message box.

8. In the `main.py` file, replace the line `window.mainloop()` with `tk.mainloop()`.

9. Ensure that the necessary dependencies (such as `pandas` and `talib`) are installed in the Python environment.

Once these changes are made, the code should be ready for execution and interaction with the user interface."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<COMMENT> The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the `talib` library, which is used to calculate the momentum-based indicators. To fix this, you need to add the import statement for `talib` in the `trading_algorithm.py` file.

<REVISION> In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add the following import statement at the top:

```python
import talib
```

After making this change, the code should be able to import the `talib` library and calculate the momentum-based indicators successfully.

Please make this change and let me know if you encounter any other issues or if you have any further questions.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code provided seems to be missing the necessary imports for the `talib` library, which is used to calculate the momentum-based indicators. To fix this, you need to add the import statement for `talib` in the `trading_algorithm.py` file.

<REVISION> In the `trading_algorithm.py` file, add the following import statement at the top:

```python
import talib
```

After making this change, the code should be able to import the `talib` library and calculate the momentum-based indicators successfully.

Please make this change and let me know if you encounter any other issues or if you have any further questions."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

requirements.txt

```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
talib==0.4.19
```

In this case, we have added `talib` as a dependency since it is a library used to calculate momentum-based indicators in the `trading_algorithm.py` module. The specified version of `talib` is `0.4.19`.

Make sure to include this requirements.txt file in your project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the required packages and their specified versions, ensuring that the project runs properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
talib==0.4.19
```
In this case, we have added `talib` as a dependency since it is a library used to calculate momentum-based indicators in the `trading_algorithm.py` module. The specified version of `talib` is `0.4.19`.
Make sure to include this requirements.txt file in your project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the required packages and their specified versions, ensuring that the project runs properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# Automated Trading Algorithm User Manual

## Introduction

The Automated Trading Algorithm is a software designed for hedge funds to automate the trading process based on a set of heuristic criteria. It uses high-performing momentum trading strategies and a number of momentum-based indicators to identify potential trades that offer maximum edge and minimum risk.

This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to install the software, set up the environment, and use the main functions of the Automated Trading Algorithm.

## Installation

To install the Automated Trading Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repository).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run the Automated Trading Algorithm.

## Usage

To use the Automated Trading Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code.

2. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will open the main application window.

3. Click on the "Run Algorithm" button to execute the trading algorithm.

4. The algorithm will calculate momentum-based indicators using the market data provided in the "market_data.csv" file.

5. You can modify the trading strategy in the `run()` function of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in the "trading_algorithm.py" file.

6. Once the algorithm finishes executing, a message box will display the result.

## Customization

You can customize the Automated Trading Algorithm according to your specific requirements. Here are a few areas you can modify:

- **Market Data**: You can replace the sample market data in the "market_data.csv" file with your own data. Make sure the file follows the same format.

- **Indicators**: You can add or remove momentum-based indicators in the `calculate_indicators()` function of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in the "trading_algorithm.py" file. You can use the `talib` library to calculate various technical indicators.
