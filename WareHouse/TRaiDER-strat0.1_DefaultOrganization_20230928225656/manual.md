# Automated Trading Algorithm User Manual

## Introduction

The Automated Trading Algorithm is a software designed for hedge funds to automate the trading process based on a set of heuristic criteria. It uses high-performing momentum trading strategies and a number of momentum-based indicators to identify potential trades that offer maximum edge and minimum risk.

This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to install the software, set up the environment, and use the main functions of the Automated Trading Algorithm.

## Installation

To install the Automated Trading Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repository).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run the Automated Trading Algorithm.

## Usage

To use the Automated Trading Algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the source code.

2. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will open the main application window.

3. Click on the "Run Algorithm" button to execute the trading algorithm.

4. The algorithm will calculate momentum-based indicators using the market data provided in the "market_data.csv" file.

5. You can modify the trading strategy in the `run()` function of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in the "trading_algorithm.py" file.

6. Once the algorithm finishes executing, a message box will display the result.

## Customization

You can customize the Automated Trading Algorithm according to your specific requirements. Here are a few areas you can modify:

- **Market Data**: You can replace the sample market data in the "market_data.csv" file with your own data. Make sure the file follows the same format.

- **Indicators**: You can add or remove momentum-based indicators in the `calculate_indicators()` function of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in the "trading_algorithm.py" file. You can use the `talib` library to calculate various technical indicators.

- **Trading Strategy**: You can modify the trading strategy in the `run()` function of the `TradingAlgorithm` class in the "trading_algorithm.py" file. Add your own rules based on the calculated indicators to determine potential trades.

## Conclusion

The Automated Trading Algorithm provides a simple and efficient way for hedge funds to automate their trading process based on momentum trading strategies. By following the installation instructions and using the provided customization options, you can tailor the algorithm to meet your specific requirements.
